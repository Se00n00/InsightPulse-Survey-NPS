<h1>About NPS(Net Promoter Score)</h1>
NPS serves as a widely employed metric across various industries to monitor customer satisfaction levels. The evaluation involves posing the question, "How likely would you recommend this product to a friend or family member?" whereby customers assign a rating on a scale ranging from 0 to 10.

Customers providing ratings between 0 and 6 are categorized as 'detractors.' These individuals discourage others from using the product and are unlikely to make repeat purchases.

Those rating the product with a 7 or 8 are termed 'passives.' While they do not actively endorse the product to their networks, they also refrain from discouraging others.

Customers assigning a rating of 9 or 10 fall into the category of 'promoters.' They actively advocate for the product and are more likely to become repeat customers.

The NPS calculation involves determining the percentage of promoters divided by the total number of customers, subtracted by the percentage of detractors divided by the total number of customers. Although passives are not directly factored into the calculation, their presence influences the percentages. Having more passives is preferable to having more detractors since passives do not count against the percentage of promoters.
